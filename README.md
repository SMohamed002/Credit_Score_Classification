# Credit_Score_Classification
- This project deals with the analysis and cleaning of the data and the selection of the appropriate model to be used from machine learning models to predict the credit score of a group of customers.
- Several techniques were used to clean the data and remove or process anything that would harm the model and its accuracy when predicting the classification. Several models were also used, such as random forest, SVC, and KNN, and each of them was evaluated.
